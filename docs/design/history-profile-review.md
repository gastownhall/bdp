# History packet review record

Status: partial council; no full-panel clearance. Non-normative.
Date: 2026-09-08. Reviewed head: `02c598aa48630a41b2d9cf9d5b08b42878e1a9d9`.
Scope: `history-profile-packet.md` and its pinned authority snapshot.
The TX apply checkout, branch and packet were excluded from every seat.

## Seats and execution

- Codex: independent native reviewer, no authoring context, no subagents or edits.
  Returned 0 Critical, 1 High, 1 Medium, 0 Low.
- Gemini: staged snapshot on stdin, workspace trusted, read-only plan mode, explicit
  prohibition on delegation and at-token expansion. Returned 3 High, 2 Medium.
  Each claim was checked against the actual packet and the provided authorities;
  there were no accepted findings based on expanded at-tokens or imagined files.
- Claude: gateway invocation failed with `401 INVALID_TOKEN`, no review. A retry
  using the existing direct login, with gateway overrides removed only for that
  process, reported the session limit until 16:30 America/Buenos_Aires. No review
  was returned, no persistent configuration changed, and no quota reset was used.

## Finding dispositions

| Finding | Disposition and concrete change |
| --- | --- |
| Codex High: erased Link revisions remain in historical source records | Accepted. H12 now queues containing-version erasure versus restricted non-serving versions, distinguishes embedded bytes from target references, names copy paths and live-source handling, and adds HR15. This is a missing design fork, not a selected erasure policy. |
| Codex Medium: durable version_id addressing claimed as implemented at #6358 | Accepted. H10 distinguishes the selected durable-address design from deferred 0068 steps 1–5 and the current single-writer restriction. |
| Gemini High: Unretained must be 410/never because the input proposed it | Not accepted as a contradiction of selected law. The proposal is explicitly input, and the actual item-3 ruling selects complete-or-refuse without a code/status/retry tuple. H5 already presents 410 as an alternative. Clarified that after-state-change does not mean polling or waiting for sync; permanent versus repairable disposition remains Donna’s decision. |
| Gemini Medium: not-tracked must use never because only operator action helps | Not accepted as established law. Operator action is a state change; no selected rule makes after-state-change an automatic sync/retry loop. H5 now states the distinction explicitly and leaves the tuple open. |
| Gemini High: HEAD statuses already form the full admission oracle | Partly accepted as a clarity finding. H8 now acknowledges the useful 200/410/404 coarse check for authorized callers in that subset. It still does not distinguish unauthorized 404, unknown revision, or the proposed 409 restrictions, and it reserves no retention. GET supplies detailed diagnosis where required. |
| Gemini High: concrete incident-deletion alternatives lost | Accepted. H12 restores both input proposals (per-Type liveness policy, source-ownership exemption) and the cost of retaining the current refusal. None is selected. |
| Gemini Medium: checkpoint token grammar is already required | Not accepted as selected law. Baseline revisions are nonempty opaque strings, unlike checkpoint tokens. H3 now expressly preserves that existing contract while reserving scheme-specific grammar for H10. |

There are no findings corroborated by both completed seats. No recommendation in
H1–H12 was marked ruled by this fold. Gemini’s proposed status changes were not
silently applied as protocol law.

## Validation and remaining gate

The change is confined to design documents. Both bundle copies and all 26 sealed
definitions remain byte-identical to main `0b7d86e7`. Whitespace and local Markdown
link checks are appropriate here; no runtime test or conformance result is claimed.

The independent Codex fold recheck returned 0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium and 0 Low:
both original findings are resolved and the recorded dispositions preserve the
distinction between proposals and law. This is a recheck, not a fresh full-panel
review. The missing Claude seat and final exact-head panel remain required before
full council clearance. Exact-head review/CI and Donna’s transition decision are
separate release gates. This record does not authorize a merge or advertise History.
